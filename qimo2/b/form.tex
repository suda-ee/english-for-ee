Shannon's discovery was truly a revolution in communication history
(J.~L.~Massey has likened it to the Copernican revolution), which
overturned the former communication theory of how to send messages
reliably, that is, send them several times, perhaps many times, and take
some sort of majority vote. Of course, the throughput, or channel
utilizaiton, decreases with such increasing repettions. Shannon showed
it was not necessary to reduce the throughput to near zero in order to
get reliable transmission, but only less than the special number C
already mentioned. Naturally, this better performance should not come
without cost; we are faced with communicating using long blocks, and
thus with presumably long delay (measured in signal intervals), and
perhaps to using rather complicated schemes for encoding and decoding.

Around 1950, Golay and Hamming proposed the first nontrivial
errorcorrecting codes, which utilized a number of redundant bits or
parity check bits, along with the information bits, to achieve better
performance than an uncoded system would achieve on the same channel.
This, coupled with the existence of stronger codes shown to exist by
Shannon, precipitated a wealth of subsequent work, and new
modulation/coding techiques are still an important research topic.

	香农的发现在通信历史上是一场真正的革命 (J.~L.~Massey 曾将之比做
	哥白尼式的革命)，它推翻了以前的关于如何可靠的发送消息的通信理论
	，既，(为了可靠发送消息)要多发送几次或者许多次，并进行某种多数表

	出为了得到可靠的传输，没有必要将吞吐量减小到接近零的程度，而只要
	比前面所提到的那个特定数值~$C$ 稍小即可。当然，(这种)更好的性能
	并不是没有代价的；我们要面对的是使用长的(数据)块来通信，从而可能

	在~1950 年左右，格雷和汉明提出了第一个重要的纠错码，除了信息位以
	外，该码使用了若干个冗余位或奇偶校验位，它与同一信道上的未编码的
	系统相比有更好的表现。这一点，再加上香农曾指出一定存在更强的编码
	，促成了大量的后续工作，新的调制/编码技术仍然是一个重要的研究课

In 1864, James Maxwell (麦克斯韦，1831-1879), a Scottish physicist,

The \underline{\ref{fil10}\hspace{12pt}} of the oscillation could be
changed by varying the capacitance of the gap by connecting metal plates
to it. The detector that he used consisted of a second coil connected to
a much shorter \underline{\ref{fil11}\hspace{12pt}} gap. The observation

showed that the electromagnetic \underline{\ref{fil12}\hspace{12pt}} from

\centerline{\Large\bf What Is a Computer?}\bigskip

The basic job of computers is the \ul{processing} of information. For
this reason, computers can be defined as very-high-speed electronic
device which accept information in the form of instructions called a
program and characters called data, perform mathematical and/or logical
opreations on the information, and then supply results of these
operations. The program, or part of it, which tells the computers what
to do and the data, which provide the information needed to solve the
problem, are kept inside the computer in a place called \ul{memory}.

Computers are thought to have many remarkable powers. However, most
computers, whether large or small have three basic capabilities. First,
computers have circuits for performing arithmetic operations, such as:
addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and \ul{exponentiation}.
Second, computers have a means of communicating with the user. After
all, if we couldn't feed information in and get results back, these
machines wouldn't be of much use. However, certain computers (commonly
\ul{minicomputers} and \ul{microcomputers}) are used to control directly
things such as robots, aircraft navigation systems, medical instruments,
etc.

Some of the most common methods of inputting information are to use
magnetic tape, disks, and \ul{terminals}. The computer's input device
(which might be a keyboard, a \ul{tape drive} or disk drive, depending
on the medium used in inputting information) reads the information into
the computer. For outputting information, two common devices used are a
printer which prints the new information on paper, or a \ul{CRT} display
screen which shows the results on a TV-like screen.

Third, computers have circuits which can make decisions. The kinds of
decisions which computer circuits can make are not of the type: ``Who
would win a war between two countries?'' or ``Who is the richest person
in the world?'' Unfortunately, the computer can only decide three
things, namely: Is one number less than another? Are two numbers equal?
and, Is one number greater than another?

A computer can solve a series of problems and make hundreds, even
thousands, of logical decisions without becoming tired or bored. It can
find the solution to a problem in a fraction of the time it takes a
human being to do the job. A computer can replace people in dull,
routine tasks, but it has no originality; it works according to the
instructions given to it and cannot exercise any value judgements. There
are times when a computer seems to operate like a mechanical ``brain'',
but its achievements are limited by the minds of human beings. A
computer cannot do anything unless a person tells it what to do and
gives it the appropriate information; but because electric pulses can
move at the speed of light, a computer can carry out vast numbers of
arithmetic-logical operations almost instantaneously. A person can do
everything a computer can do, but in many cases that person would be
dead long before the job was finished.
\bigskip

\noindent{\large\bf Types of Computer}
\bigskip

\noindent{\bf Mainframes}

Computers come in a wide variety of sizes and capabilities. The largest
and most powerful are often called {\em mainframes}. Mainframe computers
may fill an entire room. They are designed to work at very high speeds
with large data words. typically 64 \ul{bits} or greater, and they have
massive amounts of memory. Computers of this type are used for military
defense control, business data processing (an insurance company, for
example). and for creating computer graphics displays for science
fiction movies. Examples of this type of computer are the IBM 4381, the
Honeywell DPS 8, and the CRAY X-MP/48.
\bigskip

\noindent{\bf Minicomputers}

Scaled-down versions of mainframe computers are often called {\em
minicomputers}. The main unit of a minicomputer usually fits in a single
\ul{rack} or box. A minicomputer runs more slowly, works directly with
smaller data words (often 32-bit words), and does not have as much
memory as a mainframe. Computers of this type are used for business data
processing, industrial control (an oil refinery, for example), and
scientific research. Examples of this type of computer are the Digital
Equipment Corp. VAX 11/730 and the Data General MV/8000 II.
\bigskip

\noindent{\bf Microcomputers}

As the name implies, {\em microcomputers} are small computers. They
range from small controllers that work directly with 4-bit words and can
\ul{address} a few thousand bytes of memory to large units that work
directly with 32-bit words and can address millions or billions of bytes
of memory. Some of the more powerful microcomputers have all or most of
the features of earlier minicomputers. Therefore, it has become very
hard to draw a sharp line between these two types. One distinguishing
feature of a microcomputer is that the CPU is usually a single
\ul{integrated circuit} called a \ul{microprocessor}. Older books often
used the terms microprocessor and microcomputer interchangeably, but
actually the microprocessor is the \ul{CPU} to which you add \ul{ROM},
\ul{RAM}, and ports to make a microcomputer. Microcomputers are used in
everything from smart sewing machines to computer-aided design systems.
Examples of microcomputers are the Intel 8051 single-chip controller;
the SDK-86, a single-board computer design kit; the IBM Personal
Computer (PC); and the Apple Macintosh computer.
\bigskip

\noindent{\large\bf Personal Computer}

Combining the words personal and computer may give you the impression
that personal computers are less \ul{sophisticated} than their larger
mainframe and minicomputer relatives. This is a \ul{misconception}.
Advances in technology have almost eliminated the gap that was formerly
inherent in size. Personal computer systems are highly evolved
descendants of earlier and larger computer systems.

Because of this evolution, most organizations are on the \ul{threshold}
of a new style of computing in which increasing amounts of computer
resources are allocated to individual users in the form of personal
computer systems. This new style of computing relies on the
communication concepts to link groups of computers of different sizes
and types so that components of a personal computer system.

The basic hardware components of a personal computer system consist of
\begin{shortitemize}
    \item Keyboard
    \item Display
    \item System unit
    \item Disk drives
    \item Printer
\end{shortitemize}

These components perform similar functions in computers of all types and
sizes. Familiarizing yourself with what they are and what they do will
help you make the connection between computer concepts and \ul{tangible}
hardware components.

Personal computer software comes in many different varieties, and the
applications number in the thousands, so it is useful to know how
individual programs are categorized. The broadest classifications of
software are system software and application software.

System software includes
\begin{shortitemize}
    \item Operating systems
    \item Programming languages
\end{shortitemize}

Application software includes
\begin{shortitemize}
    \item Special-purpose prgrams
    \item General-purpose prgrams
\end{shortitemize}

Using a personal computer involves getting used to the conventions of
the user interface and the operating system, and then developing an
understanding of what a computer can do by becoming familiar with some
of the application software for personal computers.

	\begin{answer}
	(评分标准)语言部分参考四六级作文评分标准。其它各项要求参考一般的
	科技写作要求，规范与语言要求并重。例文如下：

	A liquid crystal display (LCD) works like sunglasses {\em by}
	block{\em ing} light by polarization.  An LCD is a thin film of
	liquid {\em which} reacts to electrical charges. It is placed
	between two sheets of glass, the bottom layer {\em of which} is
	reflective glass. Transparent electrical conductors separate the
	crystals into segments {\em which} form each digit. Any digit
	can be formed {\em by using} up to seven segments.

	{\em If} the crystals are charged, Their molecules are arranged
	in one way. {\em If} They are not charged, Their molecules are
	arranged in another way. {\em When} the conductors carry no
	charge, light is reflected out again. {\em and so} the display
	is blank. {\em When} the conductors are charged, the molecules
	in the charged segments twist, blocking light from the
	reflective surface and {\em appearing} black. {\em In this way},
	the charged surfaces appear as figures.
