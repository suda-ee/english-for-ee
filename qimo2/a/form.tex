\begin{linenumbers*}
The work of Nyquist in the 1920s, was perhaps the next major conceptual
contribution to the development of digital communications. Nyquist
developed the relationship between the available channel bandwidth and
the maximum pulse transmission rate that would support zero interpulse
interference and laid the foundation for the celebrated sampling
theorem: a frequency-limited signal can be represented by the values of
the signal taken at regular intervals if the sampling interval is
sufficiently short, that is, $T_{\rm samp}<(2B)^{-1}$, where $B$ is the
signal's bandwidth. This result allows communication to be at least a
discrete-time process and is at the heart of most modern digital
communication systems, where signals such as speech are sampled,
quantized, digitally transmitted, and reconstituted into continuous-time
signals for the user.

At about the same time, the seed for the modern view of information
theory was planted by Hartley, who reasoned that information was related
to the prior uncertainty about the message and that the amount of
information contained was proportional to the logarithm of the number of
possible messages. These ideas were not taken up again until the work of
Shannon 20 years later.

The \underline{\ref{fil10}\hspace{12pt}} of the oscillation could be

\centerline{\Large\bf Memory Address Decoding}\bigskip

A key part of any microcomputer system is the memory section which is
normally external to the CPU itself. The memory is used to hold the
program instructions which tell the CPU what to do and also holds the
data which is being manipulated by the CPU. In this unit we shall look
at the principles of some typical memory devices and see how these are
interfaced to the CPU bus system.

The memory itself consists of a large array of small storage cells each
of which holds a single bit of information. Since binary logic is used
each cell may therefore be set either at the 0 state or the 1 state. One
form of memory cell is based upon D flip-flop circuit.

By connecting a set of perhaps four or eight D flip-flops as shown in
Fig.~7-1 with their clock inputs driven from a common line but with the
D inputs from separate lines it is possible to latch or temporarily
store the states of a number of data bits which make up a word of
information. This combination of a group of flip-flops is refered to as
a register and there are several registers of this type inside the CPU
itself. Each flip-flop acts as a memory for a single bit of data and by
building up a large array of these memory cells we can produce a memory
system for storing data and program instructions.
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{fig1.png}
\end{figure}

Having produced a large array of memory cells it is usual to arrange
these so that one selected cell from the array can be connected to the
input and output data lines so that its state can be read out or a new
data state written in. The process of selecting an individual cell is
called addressing and for most memory devices the addressing scheme is
arranged so that any one cell in the array can be selected at will. A
memory with this type of addresing is called a random access memory or
RAM.

For a small memory with perhaps 16 cells it would be possible to have a
separate \ul{select line} for each cell but for typical memories with
thousands of individual cells this would be totally impractical.
To simplify addressing of individual memory cells they are connected in
an array of rows of and columns as shown in Fig.~7-2. Here all of the
cells across a row are selected togeger and similarly all of the cells
in a column are selected as a group. The data inputs for all of the
cells are joined in parallel but the logic of each cell is arranged so
that it is connected to the common data line only when both its row and
column select inputs are activated. Data outputs and clock lines are
commoned in a similar way. To select a cell one column line and one row
line are activated and only one cell at the junction of the active
column and row will be selected for a data transfer.
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{fig2.png}
\end{figure}

If we consider a 1024 cell memory array this would be arranged as 32
rows and 32 columns giving a total of 64 row and column select inputs
for addressing an individual cell. To reduce the address inputs still
further the row and column select lines are encoded in binary form. Thus
for the 32 row select lines we can use a 5 bit binary data word to
specify which particular row is to be selected. With a further 5 bit
code for the column selection this gives a 10 bit address input which
will specify the particular cell in the array that is to be activated.
Fig.~7-3 shows the basic arrangement of the addressing circuits for a
typical 1024 bit RAM.
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics{fig3.png}
\end{figure}

Apart from the address inputs a memory cell will have data input and
data output lines and various control lines as shown in Fig.~7-4. One
control input determines whether new data is to be written into the
selected cell. Reading data from a cell does not affect the data stored
in a flip-flop type memory cell so only the write action needs to be
\ul{switched}. This \ul{write control line} is usually labelled Write
Enable or WE and in most types of device it is an active low input which
selects the write mode only when the WE input is set at 0. Another
control input is a \ul{CE} (Chip Enable) which allows the \ul{write
logic} and the data output circuits to be either enabled or disabled.
This is useful where several \ul{banks} of cells are used to provide a
larger memory. Here the CE lines of individual memory chips are used as
an extension to the address so that only one device in the group is
active on the common data line when a data transfer is made. When the
memory is in the \ul{real mode} if the CE line is at 1 the data output
circuits are placed in the \ul{tri-state} mode and appear as an open
circuit to the common data bus. In the \ul{write mode} data is not
written into the selected cell unless the CE line is in the 0 state.
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{fig4.png}
\end{figure}

In some memory chips the input and output data lines share a common
\ul{pin} and are automatically selected according to the state of the WE
input. Normally if WE is at 1 the data line would be an output but the
output driver stage is enabled only when the CE line is set at 0.

In the $256\times 4$ bit RAM with bidirectional I/O buffers, when chip
enable $\overline{\rm CE}$ is LOW and the READ/$\overline{\rm WRITE}$ line
(R/$\overline{\rm W}$) is HIGH, gate 2's output is HIGH, so only the {\em
output} buffers are enabled. This allows the addressed memory word to be
{\em read} on the I/O lines. In this manner, several chips can have
their outputs tied to the same data bus without interfering with one
another, because only one chip will be using a given set of data lines
at any one time.

Two commonly used static RAM chips having a similar arrangement are the
2112, which is a $256\times 4$ bit RAM, and the 2114, a $1024\times 4$
bit RAM.
